You need the following libraries to run the code
numpy, cv2, math, heapq, time, matplotlib.pyplot


Steps to Run the code:
1. Run the given .py file.
2. Enter the x and y coordinates of the start and goal node one by one.
3. You will get the output of optimal path on the map.
4. On closing the map, you will get the Time Taken to find the optimal path in seconds.
5. The video will get saved in the background with Node exploration and Optimal path (but it takes a lot of time).
